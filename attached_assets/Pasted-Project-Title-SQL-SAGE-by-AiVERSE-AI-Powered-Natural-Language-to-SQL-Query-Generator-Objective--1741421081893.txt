Project Title: SQL SAGE by AiVERSE - AI-Powered Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

Objective:
Develop an advanced GenAI-powered system that converts natural language queries into SQL with high accuracy and ensures correct syntax. The generated SQL query should be displayed in a query editor-like interface with proper formatting. The project should feature a highly advanced UI and be deployed using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

Key Features:
AI-Powered Natural Language Processing:

Use transformer-based models (LLMs like GPT, T5, or Codex) for intelligent SQL generation.
Accurately interpret user intent and generate structured SQL queries.
Provide context-aware query suggestions.
Query Refinement & Error Handling:

Auto-correct incorrect or ambiguous SQL queries.
Optimize queries for better performance and efficiency.
Handle complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
Query Editor & UI Enhancements:

Syntax highlighting and auto-formatting for SQL queries.
Interactive SQL playground for query testing and execution.
Dark/light theme support with a futuristic UI design.
Database Schema Awareness:

Allow users to upload database schema for personalized query generation.
Support multiple database dialects (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
Deployment & Accessibility:

Deploy using Streamlit for a web-based, user-friendly experience.
Ensure fast query generation with a scalable backend.
Security & Efficiency:

Implement input validation and query safety checks.
Prevent SQL injection attacks and unauthorized database access.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Python, Hugging Face Transformers / OpenAI API (for query generation)
Frontend: Streamlit (for advanced UI & deployment)
Database Support: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (flexible schema integration)
AI Model: Fine-tuned NLP model for SQL translation
Other Tools: SQLAlchemy, LangChain (optional for LLM chaining), Syntax Highlighting Libraries
Expected Outcome:
Highly accurate AI-generated SQL queries from natural language input.
Advanced UI with an intuitive query editor for professional use.
Seamless Streamlit deployment with a robust backend for real-time query generation.
This makes SQL SAGE by AiVERSE a powerful GenAI project in Python that is major, advanced, and fully deployable! ðŸš€
